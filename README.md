# EECS2021-verilog-riscv

This is a repository of the Verilog Pre-Labs for EECS2021, a course taught at York University, Toronto, Canada.

Many students and I this term have struggled to complete the pre-labs, as they are mandatory self-learning and answers to these exercises are NOT provided by the instructors.
These pre-labs are extremely time consuming and many students simply don't have the time to troubleshoot all these codes.

Thus, I am providing my completed versions of the pre-labs with the hopes that others can benefit from the struggles that I and my fellow classmates had to go through to determine how to make this work.

Previous GitHubs published for this course were for a version of the course that used MIPS as the ISA.
However, the course has been taught using the RISC-V instruction set since around 2017; thus, the code provided in those older GitHubs are not a 1:1 resource that can be used by current students.

The corresponding pre-lab handouts can be found at this page:

https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/teaching/docs/2021/

The prelabs are K, L, M, and N.

NOTE: I will not be uploading codes for the RISC-V prelabs (A, B, C, D) because these pre-labs did not require students to figure out what the right code is; all the answers were already provided on the handouts.
